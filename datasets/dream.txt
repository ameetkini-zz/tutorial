I
am
happy
to
join
with you
today
in
what
will
go
down
in
history
as
the greatest
demonstration
for
freedom
in
the
histmy
of
olw
nation.
Five
smre
yeag
ago
a
great
American
in
whw
sp-
Imlic
shadow
we
stand
today
signed
the
Emancipation
Proshation.
This
momen~tous
deoree
is
a
great
W n
light
of
hope
to
millions
of
Negro slaves
who
had
been
seared
in
the
flames
of
withering
injustice.
It
cmm
ais
a
joyous
d:tybreak
to
end
the
long
night
of
their
captivity.
But
100
years
later the
Negro
still
is
nok
free.
One hun-
dred
yearn
later
the
life
of
t,he
Xegro
is
still
badly
crippled
by the
manacles
of
segregation
and the
chains
of
diwrimination.
One
hundred
gears later
the
Negro
lives
on
a lonely island
of
povedp
in
the
mjidst
d
a
vast
meam
of
matr.ria1
prosperity.
Ow
hundred
years
later
the
Negao
is
still
lanlgnisl~cd
ill
the
cornem
of
American
=ie$
and
finds
hinleclf
in
exile in
his
m
lad.
So
wu'vc
come
ho1.c.
today
to
(1mma.tize
a
shamdul
ccmditicm.
In
a
sense
w~tl'w
Gome
to
our
nation's
capital
to
cash
a
c+heck.
When
the
aJrrahiteet.s
o~f
our
Republic
wrote the
mzpifiemt
WOI-(1s
of
the
Constitution
and
the
hlaration
d
Lmdepcintlc.nce,
thcp
were
signing
a
promissory
note
to
which
ewry
hlerioan
was to
fall
heir.
This
note
was
a
promise
that.
dl
IWII-yes,
black

as
well
as
white
me-n-would
he
g~al.a~ltwd
the
unalienable
rights
of
life,
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
It
is
obvious
today
tha$
America
has
defaulted
on
this promissory note
inso-
fkr
as
hnr
citizens
of
cololr
arc
c.oncerned.
Ins'tead
of
,
-
honoring
this
sacred
obligation,
~me&a
has
given
the
Nepo
people
a
bad
deck,
a
check whioh

come
back

"
But
we
refuse
to
believe
that
tihe
bank
of
justice
is
tmikrupt.
We
~.ef,fuse
to
belierc?
that
there
are
insufficient
Suncis
in
the
gma,t vaults

of
this nation.
So
we've
come
to
cash
this
check,
ti
check
that
will

We
have
dw
conic

this
hallowed
spot
to
remind
America
of
the
fierce

of
now.
This
is
no

in
the
11ixui~
of
cooling
off
or
to

Now

Now

the time

Anii
that
is
something
that
I
must
say
to
my
people
who
at&
an
the
worn threshold
whioh
leads
the
palm
of
justice.
In
the prmess
d
gaining
our
rightful
plw
we
must
not
be
guilty
of
wrongful
deeds.
Let
us
not
seek
to
satisfy
our
thirst
for
freedom
by
dl-i;nking
from
the
cup
of
bithrness
anld
hahd.
We
must forever
conduct
our
struggle
cm
t~he
high
plane
of
dignity
and
diwipline.
We
must
not
allow
oar
erea-
tive
proltests
to
degenerate
into
physicd
videme.
Again
and
again
we
must.
rise
to
t<he maje&ic
heights
of
m&t.ing
physical
form
with
soul
force.
The
marvelous new
mili-
tancy
whi&
has
engulfed
the
Negro communi.ty
must
not
lead
us
t.o
distrust
all
white people,
for
mamy
d
our
white
bro;tlwr.s,
as
evidenced
by
their
presence
here
today,
have
come
to
realize
that
tlheir
destiny is
tied
up
with
our
destiny.
They
have
come
t30
realize
that
their
freedom
is
in-
extricably
hound
to
qur
fredorn.
We
cannot
walk alone.
And
rn
we walk
we
must
make
the
pledge
that
we
shall
always march
ahead.
We
cannot
turn
back.
There
are
thase
who
atwe
asldng the
devotees
of
civil
rights,
"When
will
you
be
satisfied?"
We
can
never
be

as
the
Negro
is
the
victim
of
the
unspeakable
horrors
of
,
police
brutality.

as
long
as
our
bodie~s,
heavy
with
the
fatigue
of
travel, cannot
gain
lodging
in
the
matds
of
the
highways
and
the
hot&
od

We
mnmt
be
satisfied
as
long
as
the
Negro's
basic
mobility
is
from
a
smaller
ghetto to
a
larger
one.
We
can
never

satisfied
a+s
long
as
our
children
are
atripped
of
the,ir adulthood
and
robbed
of
their
dignity
by
signs

"For
Whites
Only."
